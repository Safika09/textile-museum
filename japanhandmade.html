    "Japan is a country with high-quality craftsmanship."<br>
    <br>
    This is a quote from a book written by Muneyoshi (Soetsu) Yanagi (1889-1961),<br>
    a religious philosopher and the driving force behind Mingei (Folk Crafts) in Japan.<br>
    More than half a century has passed since Yanagi made this statement.<br>
    Although our lifestyles have drastically changed, <br>
    the spirit and techniques of Monozukuri (craftsmanship) in Japan still endure and have been passed down to this day.<br>  
    <br> 
    The Monozukuri spirit is also applied to the production of industrial goods that require advanced technology, <br>
    and it has become the foundation of Japanese design, <br>
    characterized by perfection and a relentless pursuit of improvement.<br>
    <br>
    This exhibition showcases products made using a variety of local materials <br>
    from each region—handcrafted works and traditional industrial products from Kyoto, Japan’s former capital, <br>
    where high-quality products have been continuously produced throughout its long history of tradition.<br>
    <br>
    These selected products are handcrafted by passionate young artisans from Kyoto. <br>
    Their exceptional techniques and global vision have led them to collaborate with foreign experts.<br>
    <br>
    How should we utilize the wisdom of heritage and culture in the present and future lives of our society?<br>
    <br>
    The creative artisans featured in this exhibition have explored the possibilities of its diverse future applications,<br>
    inspiring prominent Japanese designers who have integrated tradition and technology into a broader dimension.<br>
