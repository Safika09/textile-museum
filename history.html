    <p>The National Textile Museum is located in the JKR 26 Building at Lot 50 Section 70, Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin, Kuala Lumpur. Its architecture features Mughal-Islamic elements, with distinctive red and white stripes formed by alternating red and white bricks and plaster. The museum entrance, facing Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin, has two oval rectangular columns projecting from a domed wall. The building also includes two octagonal towers, each with a central dome surrounded by smaller domes. A glass-enclosed lobby was added in 2008, serving as the main entrance.

        Designed by English architect A.B. Hubback, the building was constructed in 1896 alongside the Sultan Abdul Samad building. It was originally the Railway Headquarters of the Federated Malay States in 1905. Over the years, it housed various institutions, including the Selangor Public Works Department, Selangor Water Work Department, Bank Negara, and Bank Pertanian. In 1986, it became a Textile Museum under the Malaysian Handicraft Development Corporation. Between 2001 and 2004, it served as the High Court (Appeal and Special Powers) and the Judicial Gallery.
        
        The Cabinet approved the creation of the National Textile Museum in 2005, and the building was conserved and refurbished under the 9th Malaysia Plan (2006-2010). The museum, covering a floor area of 3,145.3m², was declared a historical building in 1983 and opened to the public on January 9, 2010.</p>
