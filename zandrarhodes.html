    Zandra Rhodes<br>
    <br>
    <div class="box-1">
    As one of the British "New Wave" designers,<br>
    Zandra Rhodes has revolutionized the fashion world and placed London at the forefront of the international fashion scene since the 1970s.<br> 
    Born in Kent, England, in 1940, Zandra was introduced to the world of fashion through her mother, <br>
    who worked as a garment fitter at the House of Worth in Paris and was also a fashion lecturer at Medway College of Art.<br>
    After studying textile design at Medway and the Royal College of Art, Zandra initially began her career as a textile designer. <br>
    Shortly after, she developed her distinctive fashion designs, teaching herself to create garments on her own terms. <br>
    Her background in textile design became a key source of inspiration for her clothing, <br>
    allowing the textile patterns to influence the shape of her designs. <br>
    Her work was also inspired by various art forms, including paintings by renowned artists <br>
    such as Kandinsky, Modigliani, and Matisse, <br>
    as well as Elizabethan-era clothing at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Mexican sombreros,<br>
    and the safety pins and distressed clothing of London’s 1970s punk era.<br>  
    <br> 
    In recognition of her contributions to the textile and fashion industries,<br>
    Zandra was named a Royal Designer for Industry by the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 <br>
    and was appointed Commander of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth in 1997. <br>
    She also designed costumes for productions by the San Diego Opera,<br>
    including Wolfgang Mozart's The Magic Flute (2001), 
    the sets and costumes for Georges Bizet's The Pearl Fishers (2004 and 2008), <br>
    and was commissioned by the English National Opera and Houston Grand Opera <br>
    to design the sets and costumes for Giuseppe Verdi's Aida (2007).<br>
    <br>
    In 1999, Zandra founded the Fashion and Textile Museum in London, <br>
    designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. <br>
    The museum focuses on contemporary British and international fashion, textiles, and jewelry.<br>
    Today, Zandra continues to design fashion from her studios in San Diego and London,<br>
    producing two collections each year. She also lectures on her experiences in the fashion industry.<br>
    Objects from the permanent collection of the Mingei International Museum complement Zandra's dynamic inspiration. <br>
    The geometric designs of African Kuba cloth, the vibrant colors of Indian saris, <br>
    and the intricate patterns of Indonesian batik highlight the wide spectrum of inspiration for her textile and clothing designs.<br>
